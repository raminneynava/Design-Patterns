Overview of what is Csharp singleton design pattern
One of the commonly used design patterns in C# is the singleton pattern. This design pattern uses a single instance of a class to enable global access to the class members.

Instead of having several instances of the same class, singletons have just one instance, and provide convenient access to that single instance.

A singleton pattern can be implemented in C# in several ways, and they have the following qualities in common:

A static and open method of obtaining the instance’s reference.
Single constructor with no parameters in the public domain.
Holds references to the single newly produced instance in a static variable.
Class is kept secret.
Advantages and disadvantages of using Csharp singleton pattern
Let us examine the benefits and drawbacks of using the singleton pattern.

Benefits of the singleton pattern of design
Interfaces can be implemented using the singleton approach.
Lazy loading is possible, and static initialization is used.
It aids in the concealment of underlying dependence.
In this way, it’s simple to maintain because it only has one access point.
Problems with the singleton pattern
The following are some of the drawbacks of using the singleton pattern:

Since unit testing brings a global state to an application, it can be challenging.
Locking reduces the amount of parallelism that can exist within a program.
Static methods Vs. singleton class.
A comparison of the singleton class and static methods is as follows:

It is not possible to extend a static Class, although it is possible to develop a class in singleton form.
Even though static class cannot be created, it can be initialized by a singleton class.
When a program containing a static class is loaded, the Common Language Runtime (CLR) automatically loads the class into memory for you.
We can implement the singleton pattern in different ways, which include the following:

Safe singleton with no thread.
Singleton for thread-safety.
Using double-check locking to ensure thread safety in a singleton.
No lock thread-safe
Using the Lazy type from .NET 4.
